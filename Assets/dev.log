Non capitalism IS: no capitalists, no trade for everybody (except Aristocrats, exclude Artisan, Clerics and Goverment), no equal rights (meaning, poor strata gaves tax to Aristocrats ). Farmers are free (Serfdom abolited reform) than they just pay feodal tax to aristocrats. Add special SERf unit.
Slaves & workers pay tax to aristocrats via Factories. Farmers initially are free

* Buys less than can becouse of wrong DSB use. Turned off DSB forcing. Changed DSB. Change shortage deal
* market disbalance - Either remove needs order OR calc demand by stages for POPs - EffectiveDemand calculation does not take in account money !!

- !!!! Factory order is important for producing, since it uses same data
spend on previous expences.


- When loose supplay on food - all consumption is gone. Remove it or make price growh faster? 
	High price on food doesnt work really.
	Dont allow food shortage to happen?
